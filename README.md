# ðŸ“ˆ News Sentiment Driven price prediction

Welcome to the **News Sentiment & Stock Movement Analysis** project! This repository explores the relationship between financial news sentiment and stock price movements. The goal is to leverage natural language processing (NLP) and quantitative analysis to develop data-driven investment strategies.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

**Business Objective:**  
Nova Financial Solutions aims to enhance predictive analytics capabilities by analyzing how news sentiment impacts stock prices. This project involves:

- Sentiment analysis of news headlines
- Correlation analysis between sentiment and daily stock returns
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights

## ðŸ§ª Key Features
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive statistics (headline length, article frequency, publisher activity)

Time series analysis of news publication frequency

Text analysis: keyword extraction and topic modeling

## âœ… Sentiment Analysis
Uses TextBlob and nltk for headline sentiment scoring

Calculates a sentiment score between -1 (negative) and 1 (positive)

## âœ… Quantitative Analysis
Computes daily stock returns (% change)

Aggregates daily sentiment scores

Calculates Pearson correlation between sentiment and returns

## âœ… Visualization
Plots to visualize publication trends, sentiment distributions, and correlations

Scatter plots showing the relationship between news sentiment and stock movement

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights
Average daily sentiment was moderately correlated with daily stock returns.

Publishers with higher frequency had a stronger impact on sentiment trends.

Publication times revealed peaks around trading hours.

These insights can be leveraged to build predictive models and design investment strategies based on news sentiment.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
Enhance sentiment analysis with deep learning models like BERT.

Integrate real-time news feeds and live stock data.

Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize and monitor correlations dynamically.
